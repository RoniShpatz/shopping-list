Shopping List App Overview:
The app allows users to manage their shopping lists effectively. Key features include sharing, collaborative editing, and a specialized "active shopping mode" for easier in-store shopping.

Key Features:
User Accounts & Sharing:

Each user can create and manage multiple shopping lists.
Users can send requests to other users to share their shopping lists.
Once shared, users can collaboratively edit the lists in real time, making shopping easier for families or groups.
Active Shopping Mode:

When a user is in a store, they can enter the "Start Shopping" mode, which activates the Active Shopping Mode.
In this mode, the user can check off items theyâ€™ve purchased or mark items that are missing from the store.
This feature makes it easier to keep track of items while shopping.
Shopping Info & Missing Items:

After finishing shopping, the user can go to Shopping Info to review the items that were missing.
The app provides the date and details of the missing items.
The user can then choose to add the missing items back into one of their shopping lists.
Product Management:

The app includes a database of permanent products that are commonly purchased.
Users can also add custom products to their lists if a product they need is not in the default database.
